										<h1>Reflections for the Machine Learning Module</h1>
									</header>
								
									
<p>Machine Learning (ML) stands at the forefront of technological innovation, empowering systems to learn from data and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming (Bi et al., 2019). This module opened the door into the vast and growing world of ML and I discovered how it seamlessly builds on previous learning experiences, notably Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualisation. These skills have proven to be the bedrock upon which my understanding of ML has been built, facilitating a comprehensive and interconnected learning journey.
<p>Participating in collaborative discussions with peers throughout the ML module has been a transformative experience, enriching my learning journey in profound ways. The section of discussion around ML that I find most intriguing revolves around its application and finding the right balance between using ML as a supplementary tool and it becoming a replacement for workers. The diverse perspectives brought to the table not only broadened my understanding of ML concepts but also encouraged me to address already established views I had to alter my perception on related topics. Beyond the technical aspects, engaging with peers enhanced my communication skills, critical thinking, and ability to navigate diverse viewpoints. The collaborative nature of these discussions created a sense of community, motivating me to invest more deeply in my studies. Compared with individual or competitive efforts collaborative learning has typically higher achievement and a variety of additional benefits including improved productivity, improved relationships; and greater psychological health/self esteem (Laal & Ghodsi, 2012).</p>
<p>The first assessment of the ML module was to conduct EDA and unsupervised machine learning on AirBnB data. Since this was a group task new opportunities and challenges arose including finding the most effective method of collaborative working. Initially the team decided to conduct EDA separately to allow each member to get an understanding of the data and enabled the team to find many insights. Combining our individual efforts with regular meetings proved very fruitful as each member managed to find insights that others had missed. This experience allowed me to discover new ways of working and avenues of thought that I had previously not identified. </p>
<p>Creating a CNN was a dynamic process marked by challenges and continuous learning. The design choices, from kernel size to filter numbers, carried implications for model capacity and computational efficiency. This vast array of choices seemed daunting and overwhelming at first. Resource management became a significant concern as my desire to improve the model’s accuracy led to increased computational load. The processing time per epoch became impractical, limiting the ability to experiment effectively. Experimentation and fine-tuning were integral to refining the model. The challenge of overfitting prompted the adoption of techniques like dropout and regularisation to strike a balance between fitting the training data and generalising to new data. The complexity versus simplicity trade-off became apparent. Hussain et al. (2023) highlights the importance of balance between the required performance and the availability of resources including memory, energy, and computation power. Adding complexity to the model did not always yield better outcomes. In the future I will emphasise the importance of keeping models as simple and efficient as possible while maintaining high performance by implementing frameworks such as layer-wise complexity reduction methods (LCRM) (Hussain et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Throughout the module various tasks were set to provide opportunity for experimentation and reflection. The experimentation with different configurations of iterations and learning rates in the Gradient Cost Function task provided valuable insights into the delicate balance required for effective machine learning algorithms. The trade-offs observed in altering the learning rate and number of iterations underscored the nuanced relationship between these factors and convergence speed, emphasising the need for careful calibration. The key takeaway revolves around the necessity of finding the right balance tailored to the specific dataset characteristics and computational resources. It is clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and achieving optimal performance involves a continuous process of experimentation and fine-tuning. The reflection on these experiments underscores the importance of monitoring convergence, understanding trade-offs, and making informed decisions when selecting hyperparameters to ensure the efficiency and stability of the gradient descent algorithm in machine learning applications.</p>
<p>Discussing Unit 12 on the Future of Machine Learning offered a thought-provoking glimpse into the diverse applications of machine learning approaches within Industry 4.0, revealing the pivotal role it may have in geospatial analysis. The discussions around Geographical Information Systems (GIS) resonated with me, especially in the context of the Industry 4.0 revolution and the profound impact of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. The integration of GIS, with its capacity for spatial data analysis, not only aligns with the dynamic evolution of the geospatial sector but also serves as a powerful instrument for deciphering patterns and categorising features. Understanding GIS as a transformative force within Industry 4.0 deepens my appreciation for the practical implications of machine learning. This experience has ignited my curiosity to explore further intersections between machine learning and evolving technological landscapes, propelling me to critically reflect on the potential applications and ethical considerations in such domains.</p>
<p>Within the ML module I have gained knowledge on more than just how to create and utilise machine learning. I have gained knowledge on the potential negatives to its implication which provides me with an increased level of respect for how ML is to be used and concerns about how it may be exploited. This awareness will guide my future implementation of ML with a focus on responsible and ethical AI practices.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ML module has been a journey of growth, offering opportunities to build on existing skills, collaborate with peers, and gain insights into the multifaceted world of machine learning. Working with my peers facilitated the opportunity to learn from their combined experience and share new insights that will help to shape future improvements. Overall, the interactive and iterative learning process with peers has not only fortified my grasp of ML but has also equipped me with valuable skills and a collaborative mindset crucial for navigating the complexities of ML. My future improvement goals revolve around addressing challenges in model design, embracing ethical considerations, and pursuing continuous learning in this ever-evolving field.</p>
