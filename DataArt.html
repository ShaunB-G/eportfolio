									<p>Summary Post</p>
<p>Responses from my peers have altered my view slightly. I now see AI as a future means of assisting to fill the increasing number of jobs rather than as a direct replacement for data scientists and should used as a means of reducing the increasing burden on data scientists. As my peers rightly point out citing Dietrich, et al. (2015) the role of a data scientist should be to answer the project requirements. Therefore many employers’ demands are outside the scope of the primary focus of a data scientist, vastly increasing the requirements and skills that a data scientist must have to levels unachievable by the majority. </p>

<p>In response to Lo (2019), my peers cited Berthold (2019) in which data scientists are classified into three categories based on experience rather than skills and responsibilities. Although Berthold (2019) is using a different factor to categorize data scientists he seems to come to a similar conclusion. A novice data scientist seems to have the same skill level and responsibilities as Lo's citizen data scientist and an expert seems to align themselves to data innovators. My peers then correctly point out it is difficult for a data scientist to have all the necessary skills and experience at the start of their careers. Therefore it is important for novice data scientists to be exposed to more experiences as a data scientist to gain more experience and widen their skill set they could slowly gain more roles and responsibilities until they are able to create new insights and think outside of the box.</p>

<p>Master data management (MDM) aims to bridge the gaps between organizational units and information systems (Vilminko-Heikkinen and Pekkola, 2017) to improve efficiency, accuracy and decision making (Das and Mishra, 2011). MDM is an important process to keep a “unique view of the truth as stated by Martins et al. (2022). However, there are still many issues that relate to MDM including data governance that need to be addressed.</p>

										<p>Summary Post</p>

<p>After discussing the MODs IT code of conduct with my peers I have been opened to new avenues of thought.</p>
<p>An area that can be improved within the MOD relates to having multiple systems and networks that are unable to easily pass data between them. This means that data has to be stored on different networks which can easily cause there to be multiple versions of the same data which means any change in the data will cause multiple versions of the truth, violating the process of master data management (MDM). To eliminate this the MOD could create a centralised system that connects to the different networks allowing for data to be passed between them efficiently while maintaining a single version of the truth as described in Martins et al. (2022). 
<p>In contrast to implementing a centralised system, my peers suggested the implementation of a data mesh. A data mesh supports the provision of complex data management and access allowing data from different locations to be connected, creating a decentralised data architecture that enables the extraction of large scale data (Machado et al., 2022). Implementing a data mesh will allow the different departments of the MOD to store and process their own data while a common platform allows homogeneous interactions with the data (Priebe et al., 2021). A limitation of data mesh is that it is crucial that each team is required to maintain data governance to extremely high levels, which can be time consuming (Ryan, 2022).</p>
<p>The centralised and decentralised (data mesh) approaches have their own benefits and limitations. Centralisation does not account for different sections of the MOD having separate interests and needs for data which suggests the decentralised approach could have the greatest benefits. However, at the expense of requiring more IT resources and potential connectivity issues (Haug et al.,2022).</p>
