<p>The activity involved using Excel workbooks to Analyse dietary data and brand preference data.</p>
<h2>Worksheet 1</h2>

  <p>Task Description: Analysed dietary data and brand preference data using Excel functions to calculated sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation for both diets. </p>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Diet A</th>
    <th>Diet B</th>

</table>
<h4>Interpretation</h4>
<p>Diet A: The mean weight loss of 5.341 kg and the median weight loss of 5.642 kg suggest that Diet A was effective in achieving weight loss among participants. The relatively low standard deviation of 2.536 kg indicates moderate variability in weight loss outcomes among individuals on Diet A. The interquartile range of 3.285 kg further confirms the consistency in weight loss outcomes for the middle 50% of participants.</p>
<p>Diet B:
The mean weight loss of 3.710 kg and the median weight loss of 3.745 kg suggest that Diet B also achieved weight loss among participants, but to a lesser extent compared to Diet A.
The standard deviation of 2.769 kg indicates slightly higher variability in weight loss outcomes among individuals on Diet B compared to Diet A.
The interquartile range of 3.451 kg for Diet B is similar to Diet A, indicating a comparable spread of weight loss outcomes for the middle 50% of participants.</p>
<p>Conclusion:
Diet A appears to have a higher mean and median weight loss compared to Diet B.
Diet A also shows a slightly lower standard deviation and a comparable interquartile range compared to Diet B, suggesting a more consistent weight loss outcome among participants.</p>

<h2>Worksheet 3</h2>

                  <p>Task Description: Brand preference data for two demographic areas were analysed to understand patterns of preferences. Frequencies and percentage frequencies of brand preferences were calculated for each area.</p>

<h4>Interpretation</h4>
<p>Area 1 shows a broad range of brand preferences, with a significant portion of respondents favouring brands other than A or B.
This diversity suggests that breakfast cereal preferences in Area 1 are spread across various brands, indicating a lack of dominance by any single brand.</p>
<p>Area 2 shows a higher preference for both Brand A and Brand B compared to Area 1, with Brand B having a slightly higher percentage of preference.
Despite the higher preference for Brand A and Brand B in Area 2, the majority still favours other brands, indicating a diverse market landscape similar to Area 1.</p>
<p>Conclusion: While Brand B has a higher percentage of preference compared to Brand A in both areas, the difference is more pronounced in Area 2.
Area 2 generally exhibits higher percentages of preference for both Brand A and Brand B compared to Area 1, suggesting potential regional differences in brand preferences.
However, the majority of respondents in both areas still prefer other brands over Brand A and Brand B, indicating a competitive market with multiple players.
These findings highlight the importance of understanding regional preferences and market dynamics when analysing consumer behaviour and making marketing decisions.</p>
