										<h1>Case Study on Privacy</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>The Case</h2>
<p>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.</p>

<p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.</p>
									
										<p></p>
									<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
								<p>Ricardo is entrusted with confidential information. Releasing names and addresses without proper authorisation violates privacy policies and potentially breaches data protection laws (General Data Protection Regulation, 2016). It undermines trust in the local government’s ability to safeguard personal information. If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he should not release the names and addresses. He should refer Beth to the appropriate authority or follow established protocols to handle her request.</p>
<p>Similarly, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasises transparency, honesty, and user autonomy. The deliberate deviation from established user interface conventions and the inclusion of additional services without customer consent violate these principles (BCS Code of Conduct, Sections 1.1, 1.2). Additionally, the company's choice of colour scheme, posing significant accessibility challenges, violates the BCS Code's inclusivity and accessibility principles (Section 3 - Public Interest).</p>
<p>If Ricardo has the authority to decide on access, he must balance transparency with privacy. He must consider the potential harm or discomfort to individuals if their information is shared without consent. Ethical principles such as respect for autonomy, confidentiality, and non-maleficence must guide his decision (Beauchamp and Childress, 2019). Ricardo should ensure that any release of information complies with legal and ethical guidelines. He should consider whether the study's benefits justify potential privacy infringements and whether alternative methods could achieve the research goals without compromising personal information (General Data Protection Regulation, 2016).
</p>
<p>The Records department must evaluate the legitimacy and necessity of Beth’s request against privacy concerns. Releasing individuals' names without their prior consent could lead to unwanted contact and potential distress. There are also legal implications concerning data protection regulations (General Data Protection Regulation, 2016). The Records department should have a clear policy for such requests. If Beth’s research is deemed important and justifiable, the department should consider a mediated approach, such as anonymised initial contact where individuals can opt-in to further participation.
</p>
<p>Beth must respect the decisions of those who denied permission and handle non-responses ethically, assuming a non-response does not imply consent. Conducting the study without adequate participation can compromise its validity and ethical integrity (Creswell, 2014).
</p>
<p>Beth has the following options to handle this lack of participation:</p>

<li>Option 1: Adjust Study Design: Beth could modify her research to work with the subset of individuals who gave permission, possibly focusing on qualitative insights rather than quantitative measures.</li>
<li>Option 2: Re-Evaluate Criteria: She could assess whether a different sampling method or additional outreach efforts might yield more responses.</li>
<li>Option 3: Seek Further Approval: If critical, she could seek additional ethical review or approval to contact the non-responders again, clearly explaining the importance of their participation and ensuring their consent.</li>
<li>Option 4: Terminate Study: If the study cannot be conducted ethically with the available participants, Beth should consider halting the research and exploring alternative methods or questions.</li>
<p> </p>
									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>These scenarios highlight the importance of balancing the benefits of research with respect for individual privacy and autonomy. Ethical decision-making in this context requires adherence to legal standards, institutional policies, and fundamental ethical principles. Transparency, informed consent, and respect for participants' rights are paramount in maintaining the integrity of both the research and the institutions involved (Beauchamp and Childress, 2019; General Data Protection Regulation, 2016).
