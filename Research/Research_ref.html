										<h1>Reflections for the Research Methods and Professional Practice Module</h1>
									</header>
								
									
<p>This reflective report will detail my experiences and learnings from the Research Methods module, particularly focusing on the literature review process, research proposal development, and statistical analysis. Utilising Gibbs' Reflective Cycle and SWOT analysis, I will critically analyse these experiences, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and strategies for improvement. This reflection aims to enhance my professional practice in future research projects (Husebø et al., 2015).</p>
<p>During the literature review process, I discovered a significant quantity of information. However, I struggled to retrieve specific details later, underscoring several critical weaknesses in my approach. Initially, my method of organising and cataloguing information was insufficient, leading to difficulties in retrieval. This issue highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to literature reviews.
</p>
<p>My ad-hoc methods for storing data were prone to errors and inconsistencies. Booth, Sutton, and Papaioannou (2016) emphasise the importance of a systematic review methodology, which aids in the comprehensive gathering of relevant studies and enhances the reproducibility and transparency of research. Reflecting on my experience, the absence of a robust methodology resulted in challenges that could have been mitigated with better planning and organisation.</p>
									<p>To address these issues, I plan to adopt a more systematic approach in future literature reviews, using tools like PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). PRISMA provides a detailed framework for conducting systematic reviews, including guidelines for literature search strategies, study selection, data extraction, and synthesis (Page et al., 2021). Implementing these guidelines will help ensure that all relevant studies are identified and accurately recorded, facilitating easier retrieval and more reliable analyses (Moher et al., 2009).</p>
									<p>Additionally, I will leverage reference management software, such as EndNote or Mendeley, to organise and store research articles systematically. These tools can significantly streamline the process of citation management and allow for more efficient retrieval of sources when needed (Higgins et al., 2019). By combining PRISMA guidelines with effective reference management software, I aim to create a robust method for collecting, storing, and retrieving information, ultimately enhancing the quality and reliability of my literature reviews.</p>
									<p>When preparing my research proposal, I initially had a clear idea in mind. However, as the preparatory work progressed, the focus of my research began to shift. This deviation was influenced by the discovery of new information, emerging challenges, and evolving interests, leading to changes in the scope of what I planned to research. These shifts ultimately impacted the coherence and depth of the proposal.</p>
									<p>Throughout this process, I experienced a mixture of excitement and frustration. The excitement stemmed from uncovering new and relevant information that could potentially enrich my research. However, this excitement was tempered by frustration as the increased scope led to a more complex and unmanageable project. The challenge of maintaining a coherent and focused proposal amidst these shifts was particularly stressful.</p>
									<p>While the discovery of new information was beneficial, the resulting scope creep negatively impacted the clarity and manageability of my research proposal. On one hand, the expanded scope introduced valuable perspectives and potential areas of investigation. On the other hand, it led to confusion and inconsistency in the research approach and methodology, ultimately affecting the overall coherence of the proposal.</p>
									<p>This experience highlighted the critical importance of maintaining a clear and focused research question. A focused research question helps to guide the entire research process, ensuring that all efforts are aligned towards a specific goal. Deviations from the original question can dilute the study's purpose and lead to a fragmented and less impactful project. The lack of a structured approach in managing the scope was a significant weakness that contributed to the challenges I faced.</p>
									<p>Reflecting on this experience, I recognise that the key to a successful research proposal lies in maintaining focus and managing scope effectively. It is crucial to have a structured approach that allows for flexibility while ensuring that any changes are well-justified and do not compromise the coherence of the proposal.</p>
									<p>To improve my approach to future research projects, I will maintain a research log, and implement a structured decision making process. Keeping a research log to document findings, decisions, and changes provides a clear trail of how the research evolves. This practice can help maintain focus and ensure that any changes to the research question or scope are well-documented and justified (Robson and McCartan, 2016). Any changes to the research question or scope will be made through a structured decision making process such as the Systematic Evaluation and Decision Framework (SEDF). This process should include assessing the relevance and impact of the changes (Yin, 2018).</p>
									<p>Previously I have used R and Python for statistical analysis, this module introduced me to using Excel to perform summary measures and hypothesis testing. The experience involved using Excel’s built-in functions, Data Analysis Toolpak, and charting capabilities to handle datasets and conduct various statistical analyses. Initially, I felt a mixture of curiosity and scepticism. I was curious about how Excel’s capabilities would compare to R and Python but sceptical about its potential limitations. As I progressed, I found Excel’s interface to be more intuitive and user-friendly, which eased my initial anxiety. However, I also felt some frustration due to the lack of flexibility and advanced functionalities I was accustomed to in R and Python. I found Excel to be easily accessible and user friendly as it doesn’t require programming knowledge, making it easy for quick analyses and visualisations. The simple set up of the program allowed for efficient data manipulation and visualisation. However I did see some limitations within Excel’s statistical functions and tools as they are less comprehensive compared to R and Python’s libraries. The absence of scripting and automation capabilities will make repetitive tasks more cumbersome. Handling large datasets and complex analyses appears to be more challenging and less efficient than in R and Python. To improve my future practice, I plan to use a mixture of  Excel and R/Python. Excel will be preferable for quick and simple processes due to its accessibility and ease of use, and then transition to R/Python for more advanced analysis and automation.
</p>
									<p>Throughout the Research Methods module, I engaged in various activities, including designing research proposals, conducting literature reviews, and learning about various aspects of the research process. Engaging with these activities deepened my understanding of the research process. I realised the importance of a well-structured research proposal and how a comprehensive literature review can provide a solid foundation for my study. The knowledge of different research methodologies has equipped me with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for my research questions.</p>
