										<h1>Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica</h2>
                  <h3>Background:</h3>
<p>Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, used data harvested from Facebook users through a survey app called "This Is Your Digital Life." The app collected personal information from users and their friends, resulting in the data of approximately 87 million Facebook users being obtained without their informed consent.</p>
<h3>Impact:</h3>
<li>Ethical Standpoint: This case raises ethical concerns about informed consent and the misuse of personal data. Users were unaware that their survey responses and associated data would be used for political profiling and targeted advertising.</li>
<li>Social Standpoint: The incident led to a significant loss of trust in Facebook and heightened awareness of data privacy issues among the public. It sparked widespread outrage and contributed to a broader conversation about the ethical use of data in political campaigns.</li>
<li>Legal Standpoint: The incident led to multiple investigations and substantial fines. For instance, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for privacy violations. The case highlighted the need for stronger data protection laws and enforcement.</li>
<li>Professional Standpoint: It emphasised the responsibility of data scientists and companies to handle survey data ethically and transparently. It also underscored the importance of obtaining explicit consent from participants when collecting and using their data.</li>
									
										<p> </p>
									<h2>NHS Patient Data and Care data Program</h2>
								<p>The National Health Service (NHS) launched the Care.data program to collect patient data from various healthcare providers to improve healthcare services and research. However, the program faced criticism for not adequately informing patients about how their data would be used and not providing a clear opt-out mechanism.</p>
<h3>Impact:</h3>
                  <li>Ethical Standpoint: The program was criticised for its lack of transparency and failure to obtain informed consent from patients. Many patients were unaware that their medical data was being collected and used for purposes beyond their direct care.</li>
<li>Social Standpoint: Public backlash against the Care.data program was significant, with many patients feeling their privacy had been violated. The controversy led to a loss of trust in the NHS's handling of patient data.</li>
<li>Legal Standpoint: While the program did not break specific laws, it highlighted deficiencies in data protection and privacy regulations in the healthcare sector. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) later addressed some of these issues by enforcing stricter consent and transparency requirements.</li>
<li>Professional Standpoint: The incident underscored the need for healthcare professionals and organizations to handle patient data with greater care and transparency. It also highlighted the importance of clear communication and consent processes in large-scale data collection initiatives.</li>
<p> </p>									

<h3>Ethical, Social, Legal, and Professional Implications:</h3>
<p>These examples illustrate the multifaceted impact of inappropriate use of surveys for data collection:</p>

<li>Ethical Implications: These cases violate principles of informed consent and transparency. They show a disregard for individuals' autonomy and privacy, raising questions about the moral responsibilities of organizations conducting surveys and collecting data.</li>
<li>Social Implications: Misuse of survey data can lead to a significant loss of trust in institutions and companies. It can also cause social harm by exposing sensitive personal information and potentially leading to negative outcomes for individuals.</li>
<li>Legal Implications: Such incidents often lead to legal consequences, including fines and stricter regulations. They highlight the need for robust data protection laws and enforcement mechanisms, such as the GDPR, to safeguard individuals' privacy rights.</li>
<li>Professional Implications: For professionals in data science, healthcare, marketing, and IT, these cases underscore the importance of adhering to ethical guidelines and best practices. They also emphasize the need for ongoing education and awareness about the ethical and legal dimensions of data handling.</li>
