										<h1>Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The collaborative discussion discussed the an article by Schwab (2016) written in the World Economic Forum. The objective was to discuss the impact of industry 4.0 on a sector on interest for each contributor. 
									The documents below contain my initial post, the responses to and from my peers and my final summary.</p>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
										<p></p>
									<h2>Dark UX Patterns</h2>
								<p>In the case study "Dark UX Patterns" provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), a company deliberately redesigned its website to deceive users into unintended purchases, violating various ethical principles and codes of conduct. The company's use of dark patterns, such as misdirection and hidden costs, directly contradicts the transparency, honesty, and user autonomy principles advocated by the ACM's Code of Ethics. Such deceptive practices erode user trust and undermine the integrity and professionalism of computing professionals involved, who are expected to prioritise user interests and ethical design practices.</p>
<p>Similarly, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasises transparency, honesty, and user autonomy. The deliberate deviation from established user interface conventions and the inclusion of additional services without customer consent violate these principles (BCS Code of Conduct, Sections 1.1, 1.2). Additionally, the company's choice of colour scheme, posing significant accessibility challenges, violates the BCS Code's inclusivity and accessibility principles (Section 3 - Public Interest).</p>
<p>While many computing professionals profess a commitment to ethical conduct driven by personal moral compasses, the prevalence of commercial pressures often inhibits their ability to act in accordance with ethical principles (Beattie et al., 2023). However, it is imperative for professionals to recognise their responsibility in safeguarding user interests and upholding ethical standards, even in the face of such pressures.</p>
<p>EU legislation appears not fully equipped to address and keep pace with the fast-evolving and sophisticated nature of dark patterns, causing regulatory gaps that lead to obsolete frameworks and a lack of meaningful oversight (Novelli et al., 2024). This regulatory inadequacy underscores the urgent need for more robust legal regulations and ethical frameworks to protect consumers and ensure a transparent, honest, and inclusive digital environment.</p>
<p>The "Dark UX Patterns" case vividly illustrates ethical challenges within computing, where commercial pressures can compromise professional integrity and user trust. Violations of the ACM and BCS Codes of Conduct highlight the need for more robust ethical frameworks and legal regulations to combat deceptive design practices. Bridging the widening gap between technological advancements and legal oversight is crucial to ensure a transparent, honest, and inclusive digital environment that respects and protects user rights and interests.</p>

										<h1>Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI
</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The emergence and rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years has brought about transformative opportunities and significant ethical dilemmas. AI ethics refers to the principles and values that guide the development and deployment of AI technologies, ensuring that they are designed and used in a way that is fair, transparent, and accountable (Deckard, 2023). Correa et al. (2023) emphasises the need for better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents globally. This is crucial as different countries have varying approaches to regulating generative AI. The lack of a unified global consensus on AI ethics and governance principles can lead to disparities in legal, social, and professional outcomes.</p>
									<p>The geographic distribution of issuers of ethical AI guidelines indicates a disparity in the global approach to AI ethics, with the majority of guidelines being released by entities in the United States and the European Union (Jobin et al., 2019). This regional concentration of ethical guidelines suggests the need for a more inclusive and globally coordinated approach to AI governance.
</p>
								<p>To build a global consensus it is important to understand which values are key to all parties. Jobin et al. (2019) analysed 84 sources from around the globe to identify key values that different countries agreed on. From this analysis eleven overarching ethical values and principles emerged, the most prominent of which are: Transparency (73/84 sources), Justice and Fairness (68/84 sources) and Non-maleficence (60/84 sources).
</p>
<p>The rapid advancement of emerging technologies starkly contrasts with the sluggish pace of legal oversight, which the EU legislation seems not yet fully equipped to address (Novelli et al., 2024). While technology is moving at an ever-accelerating speed, legislation often finds itself gridlocked, regulations become outdated, and judicial processes proceed at a glacial pace (Marchant, 2011). This disparity not only results in obsolete regulatory frameworks but also in a lack of meaningful oversight. It is evident that new legal tools and approaches are essential to bridge this widening gap.
</p>
<p>The emergence of ChatGPT and other AI writing tools has had a transformative impact across various industries, offering both significant advantages and potential pitfalls. On the one hand, AI writers streamline tasks such as email composition, report generation, and document creation, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing the occurrence of human errors. This automation not only saves time but also empowers professionals to concentrate on more intricate, strategic endeavours. On the other hand, an over-reliance on AI poses the risk of diluting interpersonal interactions, potentially eroding the depth and nuance inherent in human communication.</p>
<p>Schwab & Zahidi (2020) underscore a troubling trend in the contemporary job market: the rate of job destruction is accelerating, while the pace of job creation is decelerating in comparison to previous years. The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation has undoubtedly revolutionised operational efficiencies across various industries. However, it is of paramount importance not to perceive these advanced technologies solely as direct replacements for specialised human expertise. Rather than displacing human roles, AI should be optimally harnessed as supplementary tools. By doing so, we can empower individuals to delve into and excel in roles that necessitate uniquely human qualities, such as creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. This nuanced integration of AI can foster a symbiotic relationship between technology and human expertise, leading to a more productive and innovative workforce (Jarrahi, 2018).
</p>
<p>Hutson (2021) underscores the pervasive biases embedded within AI algorithms, exemplified by inaccurate associations and gender stereotypes. Such biases are symptomatic of the imperfections in the datasets and human inputs that shape these algorithms. Additionally, ethical dilemmas emerge when AI-generated content is utilised without due acknowledgment or credit, prompting concerns about intellectual property rights and equitable compensation.
</p>
	<p>Recent ethical controversies surrounding AI usage came to the fore when Disney faced criticism for allegedly employing AI to develop one of its new films during a writer's strike. This use of AI could potentially undermine the efforts of writers to negotiate better pay and improved working conditions, further disempowering skilled individuals.</p>
									<p>The rapid advancement of AI technologies offers transformative opportunities but also raises significant ethical, legal, and social concerns. To address these challenges, it is vital to implement transparent and accountable AI algorithms, ensure unbiased and equitable AI systems, and prioritise the safety and well-being of individuals and society. Enhanced global cooperation and consensus are essential to foster a responsible and equitable AI ecosystem. Collaboration among governments, industry leaders, academics, and the public is imperative to develop and deploy AI technologies in a fair, transparent, and accountable manner, maximising benefits while minimising risks.</p>
