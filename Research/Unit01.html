										<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1 - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The collaborative discussion discussed the an article by Schwab (2016) written in the World Economic Forum. The objective was to discuss the impact of industry 4.0 on a sector on interest for each contributor. 
									The documents below contain my initial post, the responses to and from my peers and my final summary.</p>
									<h3>Learning Outcomes:</h3>
<li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.</li>
										<p></p>
								<p>In the case study "Dark UX Patterns" provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), a company deliberately redesigned its website to deceive users into unintended purchases, violating various ethical principles and codes of conduct. The company's use of dark patterns, such as misdirection and hidden costs, directly contradicts the transparency, honesty, and user autonomy principles advocated by the ACM's Code of Ethics. Such deceptive practices erode user trust and undermine the integrity and professionalism of computing professionals involved, who are expected to prioritise user interests and ethical design practices.</p>
<p>Similarly, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct emphasises transparency, honesty, and user autonomy. The deliberate deviation from established user interface conventions and the inclusion of additional services without customer consent violate these principles (BCS Code of Conduct, Sections 1.1, 1.2). Additionally, the company's choice of colour scheme, posing significant accessibility challenges, violates the BCS Code's inclusivity and accessibility principles (Section 3 - Public Interest).</p>
<p>While many computing professionals profess a commitment to ethical conduct driven by personal moral compasses, the prevalence of commercial pressures often inhibits their ability to act in accordance with ethical principles (Beattie et al., 2023). However, it is imperative for professionals to recognise their responsibility in safeguarding user interests and upholding ethical standards, even in the face of such pressures.</p>
<p>EU legislation appears not fully equipped to address and keep pace with the fast-evolving and sophisticated nature of dark patterns, causing regulatory gaps that lead to obsolete frameworks and a lack of meaningful oversight (Novelli et al., 2024). This regulatory inadequacy underscores the urgent need for more robust legal regulations and ethical frameworks to protect consumers and ensure a transparent, honest, and inclusive digital environment.</p>
<p>The "Dark UX Patterns" case vividly illustrates ethical challenges within computing, where commercial pressures can compromise professional integrity and user trust. Violations of the ACM and BCS Codes of Conduct highlight the need for more robust ethical frameworks and legal regulations to combat deceptive design practices. Bridging the widening gap between technological advancements and legal oversight is crucial to ensure a transparent, honest, and inclusive digital environment that respects and protects user rights and interests.</p>
